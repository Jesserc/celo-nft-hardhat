# CeloNFTProject
Welcome to CeloNFTProject, a repository for my personal exploration and experimentation with Celo NFTs using Hardhat. Here, you can find the contracts and tools that I used while learning about NFTs on the Celo blockchain.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repo, you will need to have Node.js and Hardhat installed on your machine. Once you have cloned this repository, navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.

Next, you will need to set up a .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:

- `KEY`: Your API key for Infura
Once you have set up your .env file, you can use Hardhat to compile and deploy the contracts in this repository by running the following commands:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat deploy
```
You can also run tests for the contracts using npx hardhat test.

Thank you for visiting CeloNFTProject. I hope you find this repository helpful or interesting as you learn about Celo NFTs.
